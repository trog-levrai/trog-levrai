# Ilan Dubois

I am a software engineer with a strong focuson data science and have worked on different topics such as mobility and remote sensing. During my university years,  I have spent a lot of time getting my hands on all kinds ofcomputer-related problems such as low level, cryptography, graph theory... Among those, I decided to get a specialization in data science. In the past, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in France, Korea, and Germany, with very diverse people in multicultural teams. I consider it one of my biggest strengths.
